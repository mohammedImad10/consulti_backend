Global Restaurant Overview Report

Our restaurant has been designed to offer a multifaceted dining experience. The dining space is divided into several functional zones:
- The main dining area, where most guests are served, is estimated to cover roughly two hundred square meters.
- An eco-friendly section, dedicated to sustainable practices, occupies about one hundred and fifty square meters.
- A VIP lounge, designed for more intimate gatherings, adds an additional fifty square meters to the overall space.

Collectively, these areas contribute to the total dining floor space, though common areas such as corridors and service zones add extra space that is not separately itemized.

Additional operational details include a building depreciation rate maintained at five percent per annum, while the decor and furniture are depreciated at around ten percent per year. Taxation and exchange rates are reviewed periodically and may vary with market conditions.
